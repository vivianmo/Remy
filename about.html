                    <h1>About About</h1>
                    <p class="text brown" > Similar to themes found on the home page, buzzwords like “women” and “style” are used quite frequently. Rather than detailing the technical function, a vague glossy euphemism of “live life as you want to live” is used in lieu. An even bolder statement, “with or without technology” gives the misleading impression that Remy may have nothing to do with technology - even though it is in fact a wearable itself. “With or without technology” implies that user is not reliant and constantly dependent on their mobile device but that phrase also just epitomizes the attempt to hide and minimize attention to the technology by literally asking the reader to disregard technology. </p>
                    <p class="text brown" > The origin story for Remy is focused on creating fashion that has tech - not adding tech to fashion. Peter Weiss’s article “Smart Outfit”, although slightly outdated, accurately predicted the natural transition from hand-held devices to wearables. Even in 1999, he anticipated the convergence of the fashion and technology industries, but alas he came to no closure on how that would come about. Seventeen years later, perhaps we are reaching the fourth stage of the SCOT model developed by Trevor Pinch and Wiebe Bijker: stabilization and closure A balance between technology companies adding fashion and now a rise of fashion companies adding technology seems to address the social group of women that were dissatisfied with clunky, feature-heavy products and redefined the problem to add technology to fashion. The creation of Remy seems like a natural result of the fourth stage of the SCOT model. However, it is interesting to note that this point of closure reeks of gender scripts.
                    <br><br>
                    As per Ellen Van Oost’s discussion on materialized gender, “...gendered user representations are an inextricably part of designing artifacts. As such artifacts are not neutral objects that only acquire a gendered connotation in advertising or in use; to a certain extent they “guide” the process of giving meaning,” (194). Wearables were designed initially with men in mind, not meeting all female needs. While the creation of these fashion-tech devices does fulfill the 4th stage of the SCOT model and is the complementary form of the male smart devices, there is something undeniably off-putting that in order to reach feminine closure, the product has to be dumbed down and wrapped in pink. This is evidence of long-standing gender scripts.</p>

                    <h1>Marketing</h1>
                    <p class="text brown" > Marketing is extremely important for fashion tech. The three sections, “For Work”, “For Play”, and “For Adventure” provide very strong scripts of use for the Remy. Since the technology in fashion tech is often underwhelming and unnovel, giving scenarios in which fashion tech would be useful is a common technique used by startups. The Altruis website has a section called “Why Altruis” in which it discusses how the Altruis can manage stress, increase productivity, and give a sense of reassurance. Likewise, Bellabeat has the sections Activity, Mindfulness, Sleep, and Period where they basically tell your how you’re exercising, meditating, sleeping, and tracking your period incorrectly and how the Bellabeat Leaf will fix that. Ringly has even made videos of women taking pictures and arranging flowers while using the Ringly. 
                    <br> <br>
                    Though you may not think you need help working, playing, or adventuring, Remy is here to tell you that you can do it better and providing a gendered script for you to follow. 
                    <br> <br>
                    The quotations link up with the stories shared on the Instagram page, perpetuating the Remy lifestyle. While the users here finally acknowledge that Remy has more to offer than a conventional bag charm, they discuss more how Remy facilitates their lifestyle, painting a glossy world. In addition, each of them do mention the aesthetic quality of Remy. 

                    </p>

                    <h1>Instagram</h1>
                    <p class="text brown" >In his piece “The Computer for the 21st Century”, Mark Weiser states: “The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it.”
                    <br> <br>
                    #myremylifestyle aims to demonstrate Weiser’s point and  showcases how Remy has seamlessly transitioned into daily life to the point where an entire lifestyle can be constructed around the Remy. Several women are featured and three specific characters are highlighted to show how Remy isn’t actually a product, but an enviable lifestyle. The women we feature are all young, wealthy, and successful. Jennifer has a successful family and professional life which appeals to mothers and working women. Brielle is the hipster with wealthy parents following her dreams. And Katherine is the prim and proper city girl always on the move. Using the curated lifestyle function of Instagram, @myremylifestyle presents scripts of use for Remy all of which emphasize the fashion and freedom a deemphasize the tech. 
                    <br> <br>
                    Without any background information on Remy, @myremylifestyle could be mistaken for the Instagram for a fashion company with its often vague captions and street style pictures of celebrities using the product. Most of the captions emphasize this lifestyle and occasionally drop hints as a wearable. The emoji use is very basic and the only technology reference is an iPhone emoji used in each post.
